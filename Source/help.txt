MandelBox

Algorithm copied from this excellent app:
http://digitalfreepen.com/mandelbox370/

All the slider boxes work the same way:
Press and hold to either side of center to affect the parameter in the specfied direction and speed.

A. Move Camera
   Press above the center line to move forward, below to move backward.

B. Rotate Camera
   Press anywhere to rotate camera in semi-controllable fashion. (algorithm needs work)

C. Changing the width of the field of view affects a zoom effect.

D. MandelBox parameter controlling the degree of box and sphere folding.

E. MandelBox parameter specified how accuratedly we determine the mandelbox surface.
   Smaller values (on the left side) result in finer resolution.

F. Mandelbox uses two parameters to determine spherical folding. Both are controlled here.
   Sphere M controls the Sphere scaling factor.

G. Mandelbox uses two parameters to determine Box folding. Both are controlled here.

H. Each widget controls two aspects of its assigned red, green or blue color.

I. Julia constant
   If enabled by toggle switch J, this 3D coordinate is the Julia constant.

J. Toggle switch enables the Julia constant coordinate.

K. Reset all params.

L. Launch save/load dialog.

M. Control the position of the light.

N. Press this to toggle image resolution between Low and High.
   Use Low resolution to quickly navigate to region of interest, then switch to Hi res for viewing.

P. Speed of Movement
   Cycle through slow, medium and fast widget controls. Good for fine-tuning the box and sphere folds.
