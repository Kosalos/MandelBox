MandelBox

Algorithm copied from this excellent app:
http://digitalfreepen.com/mandelbox370/

All the slider boxes work the same way:
* Press and hold to either side of center to affect
  parameter(s) in specified direction and speed.
* Double Tap to toggle Fast versus Slow editing.
  (Red vs Green background color)
* Triple tap to reset parameter(s).

Note: Single tap on any widget to give it the FOCUS.
      It will gain a red colored border.
      Click and drag on the image to apply the movement to the widget.
      The widgets' Fast vs Slow edit style affects the movements.

Double Tap on the image to toggle FULL SCREEN mode.

A. Move Camera
   Press above the center line to move forward, below to move backward.

B. Rotate Camera
   Press anywhere to rotate camera in semi-controllable fashion. (algorithm needs work)

C. Changing the width of the field of view affects a zoom effect.

D. MandelBox parameter controlling the degree of box and sphere folding.

E. MandelBox parameter specifies how accurately we determine the mandelbox surface.
   Smaller values (on the left side) result in finer resolution.

F. Mandelbox uses two parameters to determine spherical folding. Both are controlled here.
   Sphere M controls the Sphere scaling factor.

G. Mandelbox uses two parameters to determine Box folding. Both are controlled here.

H. Each widget controls two aspects of its assigned red, green or blue color.

I. Julia constant
   If enabled by toggle switch J, this 3D coordinate is the Julia constant.

J. Toggle switch enables the Julia constant coordinate.

K. Reset all params.

L. Launch save/load dialog.

M. Control the position of the light.

N. Press this to toggle image resolution between Low and High.
   Use Low resolution to quickly navigate to region of interest, then switch to Hi res for viewing.

P. Speed of Movement
   Cycle through slow, medium and fast widget controls. Good for fine-tuning the box and sphere folds.
   Note: combines with Fast vs. Slow editing setting,  so Slow + Slow == really slow

Q. Stereo
   Toggle stereo mode on/off.
   Image is rendered twice, for 'cross-eyed' 3D viewing.
   With the iPad held two feet away,
   slightly cross your eyes so that there is a third image in the middle.
   Relax your gaze, and concentrate only on that middle image, which is in 3D.

   The companion 'Parallax' widget controls the amount of stereo effect.
   Not all vistas work well in stereo,
   and each may need parallax adjustment for best effect.
   When it Does work, the results are fantastic!

R. BurningShip
   I have no mathematical abilities,
   but I was reading about the burning ship algorithm,
   and how it is just like the Mandelbrot algorithm
   except for using the absolute value of a function term.

   So, in the shader I added the following :
        v = clamp(v, -control.box1, control.box1) * control.box2 - v;
        if(control.burningShip) v = -abs(v);   <<---- added this

   Has a dramatic effect,
   including resemblance to the burning ship fractal in some regions.
